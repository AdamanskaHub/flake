      <h1 class="hi">Hi I'm Elena</h1>
      <p class="hero-para">I love to combine my life long passion with sealife with my new found passion for coding. I was previously working as a scuba dive instructor and kayak/snorkel guide when a friend of mine introduced me to development. I was chilling in a hammock in the Galapagos Islands, learning to code when I had that ‘A-HA!’ moment. This was the moment that I realised I wanted to become a developer. 
      </br>
I left the underwater world and stepped into an amazing bootcamp where I found out exactly how addictive coding can be and I made some new friends along the way. After the bootcamp I had the pleasure to be a part of a fantastic team at the EHL.</br>
I was given the option to choose a language to work with. I love how approachable Python is and how widely used it is, so jumped at the opportunity to use Python. Today I continue to improve my knowledge of the language either through courses or personal projects. I am seeking a full-time role where I can contribute my skills to a company.
